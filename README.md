# neptunebot-setup
bot panel for neptune/amalgamboats

for use with neptune only (because it needs textmode)

## how to use

1. download the file as a zip or `git clone` this repo

2. extract in desired location

3. go to https://github.com/TheGameEnhancer2004/TextmodeTF2, download the textmode DLL, and extract it, then CTRL+X, then go back to the panel folder, go to files and paste it there, rename it to textmode-preload.dll

4. go https://github.com/mistakesMultiplied/neptune, get the textmode dll and extract the dll file to the `files` folder along with the textmode preload one

5. get node.js and sandboxie (not disclosing how to obtain them as it's a singular google search away)

6. double click on start.bat on the root folder and the panel should start, press cancel on the firewall prompt as it's not needed

7. have fun botting and then getting E43'd in the process

expect volvo to eviscerate your accounts DoesHotter style if you actively do botting, be warned as i am not responsible for this

if you have an issue go take it to their complaint center: https://discord.gg/4MmHZfT3Su
